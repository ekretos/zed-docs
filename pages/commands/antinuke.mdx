# Anti-Nuke Protection

Advanced protection system against malicious actions and server nuking attempts.

## Overview

The Anti-Nuke system provides comprehensive protection against various types of attacks and unauthorized actions that could harm your server. It monitors and prevents mass actions like bans, channel deletions, and role modifications.

## Features

- **Real-time monitoring** of administrative actions
- **Instant threat detection** and response
- **Automatic rollback** of malicious changes
- **Customizable protection** thresholds
- **Detailed logging** of security events

## Basic Commands

### `/enable` - Enable the Anti-Nuke system

Activates ZeroDegree's comprehensive anti-nuke protection for your server.

**Usage:**
```
/enable
```

**What happens when enabled:**
- Starts real-time monitoring of all administrative actions
- Activates threat detection algorithms
- Begins automatic response protocols
- Initializes audit log integration
- Enables whitelist checking system

**Protected Actions:**
- Channel creation/deletion (monitors for mass operations)
- Role creation/deletion/modification (prevents privilege escalation)
- Member bans/kicks (detects mass moderation abuse)
- Webhook creation/deletion (prevents unauthorized bot integration)
- Server settings changes (monitors critical configuration changes)
- Permission modifications (detects dangerous permission grants)

**Detection Thresholds:**
- 3+ channels deleted within 30 seconds
- 5+ roles created/deleted within 60 seconds
- 3+ members banned within 30 seconds
- 2+ webhooks created within 15 seconds
- Mass permission changes affecting 5+ users

**Permissions Required:**
- Administrator permission in the server
- Bot must have necessary permissions to take protective actions

---

### `/disable` - Disable the Anti-Nuke system

Temporarily deactivates anti-nuke protection for maintenance or specific operations.

**Usage:**
```
/disable
```

**What happens when disabled:**
- Stops all monitoring systems
- Deactivates automatic responses
- Pauses threat detection
- Maintains configuration settings for re-enabling
- Logs the disable action for audit purposes

**When to use:**
- Server reorganization or mass changes by administrators
- Bot maintenance or updates
- Resolving conflicts with other security bots
- Temporary suspension for specific events

**⚠️ Security Warning:**
Disabling anti-nuke removes protection against:
- Mass deletion attacks
- Permission escalation attempts
- Unauthorized webhook creation
- Malicious bot actions
- Coordinated server raids

**Permissions Required:**
- Administrator permission in the server

---

### `/antinuke channel` - Set up logging channel for Anti-Nuke actions

Configures where anti-nuke events, alerts, and actions are logged.

**Usage:**
```
/antinuke channel #channel-name
```

**Parameters:**
- `channel` (required) - Text channel where logs will be sent

**Log Information Included:**
- **Triggered Events:** Detailed information about detected threats
- **Actions Taken:** What protective measures were executed
- **User Information:** Who triggered the anti-nuke system
- **Timestamp Data:** Exact time and duration of events
- **Whitelist Status:** Whether the user was whitelisted
- **Recovery Actions:** Any automatic rollback operations performed
- **System Status:** Health and performance metrics

**Log Message Format:**
```
🛡️ ANTI-NUKE TRIGGERED
User: @Username (123456789)
Action: Mass Channel Deletion
Detected: 5 channels deleted in 15 seconds
Response: User banned, attempting channel recovery
Whitelist: Not whitelisted
Time: 2025-01-15 14:30:25 UTC
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use a dedicated channel for anti-nuke logs
- Restrict channel access to administrators only
- Enable message notifications for immediate alerts
- Regular log review for security auditing

**Permissions Required:**
- Administrator permission in the server
- Bot must have send message permissions in the target channel

## Whitelist Management

The whitelist system allows you to manage trusted users who are exempt from anti-nuke restrictions. This is particularly useful for server administrators and trusted moderators who need to perform bulk actions without triggering the anti-nuke protection.

**Whitelist Benefits:**
- Prevents false positives for legitimate administrators
- Allows trusted users to perform necessary mass actions
- Maintains security while enabling operational flexibility
- Provides granular control over who can bypass protection
- Logs all whitelisted actions for audit purposes

**Security Considerations:**
- Only whitelist users you completely trust
- Regularly review and update the whitelist
- Remove users who no longer need elevated access
- Monitor whitelisted user activities
- Use temporary whitelist for short-term needs

### Whitelist Commands (Slash)

#### `/whitelist add` - Add users to whitelist

**Usage:**
```
/whitelist add @user [reason]
```

**Parameters:**

**What gets whitelisted:**
- Mass channel operations (create/delete/modify)
- Bulk role management (create/delete/assign)
- Webhook operations (create/delete/configure)
- Permission modifications (role permissions, channel overrides)
- Member management actions (mass bans/kicks if authorized)

**Example:**
```

```

**Automatic logging includes:**
- Who added the user to whitelist
- Timestamp of addition
- Reason provided
- User's current roles and permissions

---

#### `/whitelist remove` - Remove users from whitelist

## Quick Start

Get started with ZeroDegree's anti-nuke protection in just a few minutes with these essential setup steps.

### Step 1: Enable Anti-Nuke Protection

First, activate the system to begin protecting your server:

```
/enable
```

**What happens immediately:**
- Real-time monitoring begins
- Threat detection activates
- Automatic protection protocols start
- Audit logging initializes
- Whitelist system becomes active

### Step 2: Configure Logging Channel

Set up a dedicated channel for anti-nuke alerts and logs:

```
/antinuke channel #anti-nuke-logs
```

**Channel Setup Recommendations:**
- Create a staff-only channel
- Name it clearly (e.g., #security-logs, #anti-nuke-alerts)
- Restrict view access to administrators only
- Enable notifications for immediate awareness
- Pin important security information

### Step 3: Whitelist Trusted Users

Add your administrators and trusted moderators to prevent false positives:

```
/whitelist add @AdminUser Server administrator
/whitelist add @TrustedMod Head moderator - event management
/whitelist add @BotManager Bot configuration specialist
```

**Who to whitelist immediately:**
- Server owner and co-owners
- Head administrators
- Senior moderators with mass action needs
- Bot managers who configure server automation
- Event coordinators who need bulk permissions

### Step 4: Test the System

Perform a safe test to ensure everything is working:

```
/whitelist show
```

**Verification checklist:**
- ✅ Anti-nuke system shows as enabled
- ✅ Logging channel receives test messages
- ✅ Whitelisted users appear in the list
- ✅ Bot has necessary permissions
- ✅ Staff members can access logs

### Step 5: Monitor Initial Activity

Watch the logs for the first few hours to ensure proper operation:

**What to look for:**
- Normal administrative actions being logged
- No false positive triggers for legitimate activity
- Whitelisted users bypassing restrictions properly
- System responding to any test threats
- Performance remaining stable

### Common Initial Setup Issues

**Problem:** Anti-nuke not responding to threats
**Solution:** 
- Verify bot has Administrator permission
- Check if bot is higher in role hierarchy than potential threats
- Ensure bot can manage roles, channels, and members

**Problem:** Too many false positives
**Solution:**
- Add more trusted users to whitelist
- Review detection thresholds in advanced configuration
- Consider if any legitimate bulk operations are happening

**Problem:** Missing log messages
**Solution:**
- Verify bot can send messages in the log channel
- Check channel permissions for the bot
- Ensure channel isn't set to slow mode

- Lowest chance of successful attacks

#### Medium Sensitivity (Balanced approach)
- Triggers on 3+ suspicious actions within 30 seconds
- Moderate response time with some tolerance
- Good for servers with varied activity levels
- Balance between security and usability

#### Low Sensitivity (Large servers only)
- Triggers on 5+ suspicious actions within 45 seconds
- Delayed response with higher tolerance
- For servers with frequent legitimate mass actions
- Higher risk but fewer false positives
