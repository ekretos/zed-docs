## Part 3: Creating Interactive Buttons

### Step 6: Add Your First Button

Click **🔘 Add Buttons** to make your embed interactive.

**Button Configuration:**
- **Label** - Text displayed on button
- **Style** - Visual appearance (Primary, Secondary, Success, Danger, Link)
- **Emoji** - Optional emoji (e.g., 🎭, 🎮, 📝)

### Step 7: Create a Role Assignment Button

**Example: Gaming Role Button**
```
Label: "Get Gaming Role"

Emoji: 🎮
Action Type: TagScript
```

**TagScript Code:**
```tagscript
{require(verified):You must be verified to get roles!}
{role(toggle):GAMING_ROLE_ID}
{if({member.roles.has(GAMING_ROLE_ID)}):
✅ Gaming role assigned! Welcome to the gaming community.
|:
❌ Gaming role removed. You can get it back anytime!
}
```

*Replace `GAMING_ROLE_ID` with your actual role ID*

### Step 8: Add Multiple Role Buttons

Create additional buttons for different roles:

**Art Role Button:**
```tagscript
{role(toggle):ART_ROLE_ID}
{if({member.roles.has(ART_ROLE_ID)}):
🎨 Art role assigned! Check out #art-showcase
|:
🎨 Art role removed.
}
```

**Event Notifications Button:**
```tagscript
{role(toggle):EVENTS_ROLE_ID}
{if({member.roles.has(EVENTS_ROLE_ID)}):
📅 You'll now receive event notifications!
|:
📅 Event notifications disabled.
}
```

```

**Role-Specific Content:**
```tagscript
{if({member.roles.has(VIP_ROLE_ID)}):

|:
{if({member.roles.has(PREMIUM_ROLE_ID)}):
Hello Premium member! Enjoy your benefits.
|:
Welcome regular member! Consider upgrading for more features.
}
}
```

### Step 10: Dynamic Information Buttons

**Server Stats Button:**
```tagscript
📊 **Server Statistics**

👥 Members: {guild.membercount}
🏷️ Your Roles: {member.roles.length}
📅 Joined: {member.joinedAt:YYYY-MM-DD}
⏰ Server Time: {now:HH:mm UTC}
```

**User Info Button:**

## Best Practices & Tips

### Design Guidelines

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Use consistent colors throughout your server
- Limit embeds to 3-4 fields for readability
- Choose emojis that match your server theme
- Keep button labels short and clear

**Content Organization:**
- Group related buttons together
- Use descriptive field names
- Write clear, concise descriptions
- Include helpful instructions

### TagScript Optimization

**Performance Tips:**
- Use specific role checks instead of broad permissions
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Minimize API calls in scripts
- Test scripts thoroughly before deployment

**Security Considerations:**
- Always validate user permissions
- Use `{require()}` for sensitive actions
- Implement rate limiting for buttons
- Log important actions for audit trails

### Maintenance and Updates

**Regular Reviews:**
- Update role IDs if roles change
- Refresh outdated information
- Test buttons after server changes
- Monitor button usage statistics

**Version Control:**
- Keep backup copies of complex embeds
- Document TagScript changes
- Use descriptive embed names
- Track embed performance metrics

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Button Not Working

**Solutions:**
1. Review `{require()}` statements
2. Check user roles and permissions
3. Verify channel-specific permissions
4. Update permission checks in TagScript

### Embed Not Displaying

**Solutions:**
1. Check embed content length limits
